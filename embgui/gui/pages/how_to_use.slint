Mouse Tracker allows you to initiate a backup process using a simple mouse gesture. Once you've configured the software with your desired backup settings, follow these steps to perform a backup:

    Activate Mouse Tracking: Ensure Mouse Tracker is running and has mouse tracking active. Click the "Start Tracking" button if it's not already active.

    Initiate the Backup Command: Touch all four edges of your monitor with your mouse cursor in quick succession. This will trigger the backup command.

    Confirm Backup: A confirmation window will appear, notifying you that the backup command has been received. If you want to proceed with the backup, simply wait for the tracking window to elapse. The tracking window is the time limit within which you must complete the 4-edge touch gesture to trigger the backup. You can adjust this duration in the Settings menu.

    Monitor Backup Progress: Once the backup process starts, a progress window will appear. This window will show you the status of the backup operation, including the percentage completed, the current file being backed up, and the estimated time remaining.

    Backup Completion: Once the backup process is complete, the progress window will indicate that the backup has finished successfully. You can now close the progress window and continue using your computer.
